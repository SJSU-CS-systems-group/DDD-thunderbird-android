# This is a fork of the amazing K-9 Mail codebase

K-9 Mail is an open-source email client for Android.

Our fork, referred to as DDD, works with the Disconnected Data Distribution infrastructure ( http://discddd.net ) to bring email to disconnected areas of the world.

You will want to check out the https://github.com/SJSU-CS-systems-group/DDD project as well since that is were the code for the DDD Client and Transport live.
